### Presentations
[Introduction to Pandas](https://github.com/els-pnw/QECamp19-Intro-to-pandas/)
<br>
A presentation I did for our 2019 Software Quality Engineering conference (QE Camp).  

Offers a quick introduction to Python pandas and sqlalchemy.  For the pandas demo all data was randomly generated.

The SQLAlchemy demo does require a configuration.  The demo read data from a Siemens Polarion database; however, this is easily modified to support other databases.
