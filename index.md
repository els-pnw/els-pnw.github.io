[PyTest Marker For Bugzilla](https://github.com/els-pnw/pytest_marker_bugzilla/)
<br>
A project that enables software engineers to assign a bugzilla number to a particular test.  Once assigned the test will run or skip based on the status of bug.  The status of the bug is determined via a real-time look up of the bugzilla.

**Note** The project has gone somewhat stale as technologies have evolved since the projects initial development.

### Presentations
[Introduction to Pandas](https://github.com/els-pnw/QECamp19-Intro-to-pandas/)
<br>
A presentation I did for our 2019 Software Quality Engineering conference (QE Camp).  

Offers a quick introduction to Python pandas and sqlalchemy.  For the pandas demo all data was randomly generated.

The SQLAlchemy demo does require a configuration.  The demo read data from a Siemens Polarion database; however, this is easily modified to support other databases.
